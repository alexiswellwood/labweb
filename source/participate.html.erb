ChiLDlab is moving in August 2017, so we will no longer be running studies in Evanston!

<br /><br />
You and your family can still participate in awesome language-related research on Northwestern's Evanston campus, by participating in studies through the <a href="http://childstudies.northwestern.edu">Child Studies Group</a>. CSG is a group of labs on Northwestern's Evanston campus that studies child speech and language: <a href="http://childstudies.northwestern.edu">check them out</a>!
