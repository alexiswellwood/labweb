Rebecca has won the Northwestern Linguistic Department's Demoz prize, awarded in honor of the late professor Abraham Demoz (read about him [here](http://www.linguistics.northwestern.edu/undergraduate/award/abraham-demoz.html)). Today, the prize recognizes outstanding contributions to the research and academic environment of linguistics at Northwestern by an undergraduate student. Rebecca certainly deserves it: since becoming a linguistics major only in 2015, Rebecca has presented original research in a graduate-level linguistics conference (the Semantics Workshop of the American Midwest and Prairies), and provided invaluable assistance in making the ChiLDlab a success. The award ceremony will take place tomorrow along with lunch in the Linguistics House classroom. All congratulations to Rebecca!
