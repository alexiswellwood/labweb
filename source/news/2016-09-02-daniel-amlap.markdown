Daniel's research with Alexis and a collaborator at the University of Cologne, [Barbara Tomaszewicz](http://www-scf.usc.edu/~btomasze/), was presented at this year's Architectures and Mechanisms for Language Processing in Bilbao, Spain. Daniel's project investigates how people understand sentences with 'implicit negation' like you find in the marked adjective of an antonymic pair like *tall*/*short*. This research recalls earlier findings from cognitive psychology that negative words take longer to process than positive words, but extends it in interesting ways. The poster reports results from both English and Polish, establishing the crosslinguistic validity of the effect, as well as results from eye-tracking. This research will help us better understand the relationship between linguistic structure and non-linguistic cognition.
