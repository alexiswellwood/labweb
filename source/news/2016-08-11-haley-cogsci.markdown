Haley reported on her joint work with Alexis at the annual meeting of the Cognitive Science Society in Philadelphia. This work investigates how people recruit visual information when they understand simple verbal comparatives like *Ann jumped more than Bill did*. In her poster, Haley described the results of two experiments investigating how vision is recruited while watching dynamic displays as a function of the choice of verb--*move* or *jump*--when the dimension of comparison is underspecified. That is, with *higher*, *longer*, or *more times*, it should be clear what the dimension is--height, duration, or number--but with just *move more* or *jump more*, the dimension seems like it might depend on the verb. Haley indeed found a difference between the verbs when the word *more* was used, but no difference with the other comparative words!
