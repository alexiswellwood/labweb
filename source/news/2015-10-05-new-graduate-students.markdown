Haley Farkas, first year graduate student in the Linguistics department, and Daniel Tucker, third year graduate student in Linguistics, have joined our team! Haley is primarily interested in semantics and language acquisition, and will be heading a lab project aiming to understand how children and adults understand comparisons between sets of events. Daniel is primarily interested in morphology, semantics, and computational modeling, and heads up a lab project aimed at understanding how children and adults understand adjectives like tall and their antonyms, like short.
