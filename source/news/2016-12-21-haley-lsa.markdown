Haley will present collaborative research with Alexis at the annual meeting of the Linguistic Society of America in early January. This research increases our understanding of how speakers integrate linguistic and visual information when evaluating dynamic scenes. In particular, it suggests that adults have highly detailed implicit knowledge of how quantifier words like *more* work, and it attempts to shed light on the nature of that knowledge. Currently, Haley is designing a follow-up study in a Cognitive Science fellowship directed by Alexis and Steve Franconeri of Northwestern's [Visual Thinking lab](http://viscog.psych.northwestern.edu/). This project will investigate the finer-grained distinctions made in visual perception that she can recruit for further studies of the language-cognition interface.
