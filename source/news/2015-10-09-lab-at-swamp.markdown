Rebecca and Nayoun will be representing Northwestern this year at the Semantics Workshop of the American Midwest and Prairies (SWAMP). Rebecca's project (co-authored with Alexis) investigates the ambiguous meanings of sentences like *This airplane is flying less high than any plane can fly*, and Nayoun's project (co-authored with <a href="http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~myo507/" target="_blank">Masaya Yoshida</a>, and Alexis) investigates the grammatical properties of questions with *why* in English. Congratulations, gals, and best of luck at the conference!
