Rita will be participating in a program called the Danish Institute for Study Abroad from January-May of 2016, where she will be taking a Danish Language and Culture class, as well as Sociology classes. She is especially excited about a Sociology class called "Learning in Scandinavian Classrooms," since the education system in Scandinavia is very different from that in the US. She will also take an Urban Studies/Sociology course, which includes a weeklong trip to Budapest and Vienna. Only her second time out of the country, she is also hoping to travel to a few other countries after the Danish semester is finished!
