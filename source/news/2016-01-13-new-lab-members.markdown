ChiLDlab is excited to welcome our newest research assistant, Zoe Brockman. Zoe is a recent graduate of Northwestern's Creative Writing program. She is interested both in the fascinating ways that language can be used to make meaning, as well as how children acquire this ability. This quarter, she will be helping to run studies involving how children and adults understand words like *most*, *more*, *tallest*, and *shorter*. A big welcome to Zoe!
