The Child Language Development Lab's space is now established, in 102-103 Cresap Laboratory on Northwestern University's Evanston campus! The lab is decorated in warm, bright orange and green colors, and features large windows with a view onto Lake Michigan. In the coming weeks, the lab will continue to grow its space and personnel so that research can begin in earnest when Northwestern's fall quarter begins near the end of September 2015. Along with the physical space, as the lab's digital space is coming together---welcome to the ChiLDlab online!
