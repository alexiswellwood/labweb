The lab will have a pot-luck holiday party this Friday, December 4th, at 4pm in Cresap 102-103. There is much to celebrate at the end of our very first quarter as a fully-functioning lab: in just 3 short months, the lab went from a 2-member team consisting of just Alexis and Casey, to a bustling team of 7! We designed and began running our first studies with both children and adults, and the results are coming in quickly. We are investigating how people understand expressions like *more* and *most*, *tall* and *less tall*, and how they think about simple kinds of events like *jumping*. We also celebrate Rita's accomplishments this quarter, as we wish her well on her study-abroad trip to Denmark!
