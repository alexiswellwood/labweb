In blue, the ChiLDlab logo, and in red, an earlier prototype of the ChiLDlab logo, back by popular demand (that is: Haley)!  Casey incorporated Yuko's drawings into the two design schemes. So far, we have only ordered a limited run for distributing to lab members. Everyone is pretty excited to have both their coffee and their ChiLDlab too!
