The Meaning Lab (ML) at University of Southern California is live! ML is a hub for interdisciplinary research focused primarily on the nature of human language and thought. As part of USC's <a href="https://dornsife.usc.edu/phil
">School of Philosophy</a>, we leverage scientific methods drawn from linguistics and cognitive psychology towards addressing the big questions in the philosophy of language and mind. The Meaning Lab was built on the foundation established by the Principal Investigator, Professor Alexis Wellwood, in her construction of the ChiLDlab at Northwestern University. You cans still learn about the people, research, and news from ChiLDlab across the ML website. But along with the move to Southern California, and the change in name, comes a broader vision: in addition to investigating what adults know about language, and how children come to acquire that knowledge, ML studies the relationship between words and concepts, and between language and thought.
