Rebecca Way and Rita Hirami, Northwestern undergraduate students, have joined our team! Rebecca has interests in natural language semantics, computational semantics, and is the brains behind much of the programming currently being done in the lab. Rita is primarily interested in sociolinguistics and anthropology; in the lab, so far she has proven a whiz with designing materials for fun games to play with children.
