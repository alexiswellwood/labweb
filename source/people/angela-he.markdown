Dr. Angela Xiaoxue He received her PhD in Linguistics from the University of Maryland, College Park, in 2015. She studies how young children figure out the meanings of words and sentences, given a high degree of uncertainty in the language they're exposed to. In carrying out this research, she examines the role of learning biases, processing ability, event representation, social-communicative ability, and the dynamic interactions between these factors. Her research compares acquisition patterns in different exposure languages, and in learners with different developmental profiles.
