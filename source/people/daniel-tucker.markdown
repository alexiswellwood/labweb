Daniel is a 4th year Linguistics PhD student. His research focuses on morphosemantics, with an emphasis on links between cognitive psychology and linguistic theory. Specifically, Daniel is interested in tying what we know about the world's languages (i.e. typological linguistic universals) with theories of how adults and children represent meanings. Daniel's previous research has focused on writing systems analysis and models of cross-linguistic perceptual span size differences. His other interests include Altaic languages, ancient languages, curriculum design and development, teaching, and the gameification of language learning.
