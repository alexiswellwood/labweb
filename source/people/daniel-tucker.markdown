Daniel is a 3rd year Linguistics PhD student, and currently serves as assistant director of English Language Programs. His research focuses on the acquisition of morpho-semantics, with an emphasis on links between cognitive psychology and linguistic theory. Specifically, Daniel is interested in tying what we know about the world's languages (i.e. typological linguistic universals) with theories of how adults and children represent meanings. Daniel's previous research has focused on writing systems analysis and models of cross-linguistic perceptual span size differences. His other interests include Altaic languages, ancient languages, curriculum design and development, teaching, and the gameification of language learning.
