Casey received her B.A. in Economics and Linguistics in June 2015 from Northwestern University. Her focus has since shifted towards Computer Science and the intersection of business and technology. She has been attending classes and designing/coding projects for web/mobile in and out of the lab, and she is interested in how the ChiLDlab can apply Computer Science to automate data capture, visualization, and sharing. As a jazz/latin pianist and drummer, when not in the lab Casey enjoys making music, exploring Chicago's music scene, and learning to DJ.
