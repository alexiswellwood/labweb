Alexis' research focuses on how meaning is expressed in natural language, and on how speaker understanding of the meanings of words and sentences relates to other aspects of mind, both in adults and children. She received her PhD in Linguistics from the University of Maryland in 2014, and waas an Assistant Professor at Northwestern University from 2014 to 2017. She joined the USC Philosophy faculty at USC in Fall of 2017, and earned a courtesy appointment with the USC Linguistics faculty in Fall of 2018. She has authored or co-authored numerous journal articles in natural language semantics and language acquisition, and her first book will soon be published through Oxford University Press.
