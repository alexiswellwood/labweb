Alexis' research focuses on how meaning is expressed in natural language, and on how speaker understanding of the meanings of words and sentences relates to cognitive function both in adulthood and in development. She received her PhD in Linguistics from the University of Maryland in 2014, and has been an Assistant Professor at Northwestern since fall of 2014.  She is the author or co-author of numerous journal articles in natural language semantics and language acquisition, and she is presently working on a book manuscript.
