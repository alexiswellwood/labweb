Alexis' research focuses on how meaning is expressed in natural language, and on how speaker understanding of the meanings of words and sentences relates to other aspects of mind, both in adults and children. She received her PhD in Linguistics from the University of Maryland in 2014, and was an Assistant Professor at Northwestern University from 2014 to 2017. She joined the faculty of the Dornsife School of Philosophy in Fall 2017, and was given a courtesy appointment in the Department of Linguistics in Fall 2018. She is currently the sole Principal Investigator on the NSF-funded project, "Individuating and comparing objects and events", and she has authored or co-authored numerous journal articles in semantics and language acquisition. Her first book, <i>The semantics of "more"</i>, will soon be published by Oxford University Press.
