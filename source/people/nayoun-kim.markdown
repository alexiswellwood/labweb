Nayoun's primary interest is in psycholinguistic investigation, particularly how syntactic representations are encoded and retrieved in real-time. In psycholinguistics, she has investigated the processing of different types of *wh*-question constructions, elliptical constructions, and selective fallability. She combines this research with her interests in syntactic theory, where she has investigated the grammatical properties of *why*-questions and various elliptical phenomena. Looking forward, she would like to investigate how semantics influences sentence processing, and how real-time semantic interpretation relates to cognitive function in adulthood and in development.
