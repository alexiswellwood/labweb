Matias is a junior studying Philosophy, Entrepreneurship, and Religion at the University of Southern California. He's an avid reader, a novice sailor, and a proud research assistant to the USC Meaning Lab. He's excited to learn more both in his academic and extracurricular pursuit of philosophy, and hopes that the work he does both now and in the future will always be in pursuit of truth.
